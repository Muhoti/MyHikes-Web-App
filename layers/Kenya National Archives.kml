It was established in 1965 and holds 40,000 volumes. It also houses the Murumbi Gallery which is currently the largest Pan-African art gallery in Africa and contains ancient art collections from different regions and communities of Africa. The collected artifacts were acquired by the government of Kenya after a concessionary arrangement was agreed upon with Joseph Murumbi, who had initially turned down several huge offers to buy his collections by overseas bidders]]></description>
